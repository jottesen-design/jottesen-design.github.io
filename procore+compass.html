                <span class="subhead">Executive Summary:</span>
        
                <p>I led the design and product vision for Procore through a strategic partnership with COMPASS By Bespoke Metrics, a third party pre qualification tool that gathers data about subcontractors. The partnership involved integrating subcontractor data into Procore’s Bidding tool and additional tools in the construction platform for general contractors to view and consume. In conceptualizing and delivering this initiative we signed the largest customer deal for Bidding, reactivated 10 enterprise customers, and built a long term vision to sell to future customers.</p>
                
                
                <span class="subhead">My Role:</span>
        
                <p>As the lead designer on this project I partnered the director of product and product manager on customer research, strategy, and product vision. In addition I led the design direction of this third party partnership. </p>
                
                <span class="subhead">Timeline:</span>
        
                <p>6 Months (Jan - Sep 22’)</p>
                
                
                
                <div class="smspacer"></div>
                
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <h3>Inviting the qualified subcontractors to bid a construction project is the best way to manage risk in the preconstruction phase, yet Procore’s Bidding tool provided no way for users to access or request subcontractor data. </h3>
                
                 <div class="smspacer"></div>
                
                <p>The goal of the pre-construction process is to manage and mitigate risk before the project starts. Early in the process, general contractors will request pre-qualifications data from businesses, things like business information, average contract value, insurance coverage, past projects, OSHA reports, references, etc. 

                Many of the data points gathered in a pre-qualification form are valuable during the bidding process. Estimators and project managers during bidding are focused on inviting the most qualified businesses for the project. 

                With Procore’s lack of integration of pre-qualification data into the bidding tool, it made it difficult for enterprise general contractors to adopt the tool leading to them building custom in house solutions or going to our competitors.

                <div class="lgspacer"></div>
                
                <hr class="line">
                
                <div class="lgspacer"></div>
                
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h3>Increase speed of Bidding through enhanced data informed decision making and mitigate the risk of inviting the wrong subcontractor. </h3>
                
                 <div class="smspacer"></div>
                
                <p>Our goals were to (1) streamline the bidding process by reducing the time needed to collect and manage subcontractor pre-qualification data during the bidding process, (2) provide pre construction teams with access to comprehensive subcontractor information to facilitate informed decision-making when selecting subcontractors for projects, and (3) Enhance risk identification and mitigation by ensuring that only qualified and reputable subcontractors are considered for projects. 

                This would lead to increased engagement with the bidding tool, reactivation and boost in sales from enterprise level ENR 400 (top rated construction companies world-wide by revenue) contractors. 
                </p>
                
                <div class="lgspacer"></div>
                
                  <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <h3>A faster and more flexible way to view or request subcontractor data from Procore’s Bidding tool. </h3>
                
                 <div class="smspacer"></div>
                
                <p>Fully integrated pre-qualification data from Compass by Bespoke Metrics (third party tool) into the Procore Platform. Estimators and project managers can view and request pre-qualification data before, during or after the bidding process. This allows the pre-construction team to review and vet businesses early in the bidding process so they award contracts to the most qualified businesses for the project.  
                </p>
                
                <div class="xsspacer"></div>

                  <span class="subhead">Crafting the Vision</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>The integration of qualification data into Procore’s Bidding tool is only a small part of the long term vision for this partnership. As mentioned earlier, in research we found that qualification data is needed at different stages of the construction project.  </p> 
                
                <div class="lgspacer"></div>
                
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <h3>Largest deal for the Bidding tool signed, CEO buy-in, and reactivated 8 enterprise customers.  </h3>
                
                 <div class="smspacer"></div>            
                
                <span class="subhead">Largest Bidding Deal Signed</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>During the early stages of research we partnered with one of Procore's largest clients to understand their needs for Preconstruction. As I involved them in discovery calls they became more and more investing in the solution, this led to them purchasing Procore’s bidding tool as the largest deal for the team at $350,000 per year. </p>
                
                <span class="subhead">Customer reactivation </span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>During the pilot we were able to reactivate 8 enterprise customers back on to Procore’s Bidding tools. </p>       
                
                <span class="subhead">Leadership Buy-In</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>Through consistent sharing of our work from discovery insights to the initial pilot, leadership had strong buy in on this project. Here is a quote from the CEO of Procore: "I just watched the Compass integration video which frankly is one of the most powerful new features I've seen in Procore in some time… Our customers are going to LOVE this.”</p>

                <div class="smspacer"></div>
                
                
                <span class="subhead">The solution</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>Based on metrics from previous user testing, interviews with CSMs and support specialists, I redesigned the order page that simplified inputs, provided recommendations, educated and guided non-technical users and created consistency with other order pages.</p>
                
                <span class="subhead">The goals</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>To make sure we weren’t redesigning for the sake of just refreshing the page’s UI, I wanted to establish the goals/metrics with design and offering management. Design management goals were straightforward: build consistency, simplify, increase NPS score and create a great user experience. Offering management goals focused more on revenue: increase sales of newest servers and increase the purchase of add-ons.</p>
                
                <span class="subhead">The impact</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>
                – 300% increase in user interaction w/ add-ons<br>
                – 23% increase in add-ons sales<br>
                – Delivered new reusable component for add-ons and OS selector
               

                </p>
                
                
                 <div class="lgspacer"></div>
            
            <span class="subhead1">Before + after</span>
                <div class="smspacer"></div>
        
                <span class="subhead">Add-ons</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>Grouping all of the add-ons together at the bottom of the page ended up making the most sense after going through a round of user testing. One of the big improvements we made to add-ons was adding descriptions. In testing, users had difficulty understanding what each add-on provided them. I worked with the OM to find and come up with descriptions for each add-on then, we reviewed each one with the content team. This same add-on component was contributed back to IBM Cloud’s design system for other teams to reuse on their order pages.</p>

                <div class="xsspacer"></div>
        
                <span class="subhead">Recommended tags</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>Smart defaults (i.e., defaulting selections based on customer data) were difficult to implement based on feedback from the development team who stated multiple API calls would slow the performance of the page. When interviewing CSMs, we found that many non-technical users navigate this order page. To address their needs, we added recommended tags to key selections that would help users decide on a selection quicker. These 'recommended tags’ were decided by the offering manager based on most commonly selected options.</p>
                
                 <div class="xsspacer"></div>

                <span class="subhead">Operating system selector</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>The operating system selector was long overdue for a redesign. During discussions with the support team, we learned that many customers had difficulty finding and adding the OS version. The click target for selecting the OS version was very small making it difficult to see and select. The new OS selector now aligns better with competitors and creates a simpler selection process.</p>
                
                 <div class="xsspacer"></div>

                <span class="subhead">Profile selection</span>
                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>The profile selector component had been newly introduced by the IBM Cloud design system team. However, I made some additional tweaks to enhance the user’s experience further. The big value adds to customers included, feature filters, a sortable pricing column, a tooltip for server details, and featured tags representing most commonly purchased servers.</p>

                <div class="xxsspacer"></div>
                <p>Finding IBM clients to test with was one of the main limitations of this project. However, I tried to be resourceful in this situation. To compensate for the lack of IBM clients to test, I scheduled feedback sessions with CSMs that worked with customers regularly, and met with 7 CSMs and 3 support specialists. These meetings provided me with insight regarding customers and the pain points they were facing.</p>
                
                <span class="subhead">Research can influence</span>
